# PyBer Analysis

## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to compare ride-sharing across city types. Urban, suburban, and rural ride sharing data is compared.

## Resources
- Python version 3.7.11
- Matplotlib version 3.5.0
- Code Document: PyBer_Challenge.ipynb

## Results
There were several differences between the different city types.

The results of each city type's average fare for the first four months of the year was graphed.

#### Rural
- Rural city types had lower numbers of drivers, total rides, and total fares.
- Rural city types had the highest average fare per ride and average fare per driver
#### Suburban
- Suburban city type fell between urban and rural for all metrics evaluated (total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver).
#### Urban
- Urban city types had the highest number of drivers, total rides, and total fares.
- Urban city types had the highest average fares per ride and average fare per driver.

## Summary
Based on the analysis, we recommend the following to address disparities among city types:
- **Recommendation 1:** There are fewer rides in rural and suburban city types. Advertising to non-urban city dwellers could increase the number of people utilizing ride-sharing.
- **Recommendation 2:** There are fewer drivers in rural and suburban city types. Driver incentives for non-urban drivers could increase the number of drivers available.
- **Recommendation 3:** The last week of February showed a slight increase in total fares. Before this time frame in coming years, increasing visibility of ride-sharing options could increase utilization even more.
